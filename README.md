# Railway-Reservation-System-Website
This is a Semi-Responsive-Website for Railway (Train) Reservation System

In order to manage train, booking, payment, seat, and ticket details, the Railway Reservation System website was created. It builds a structure for controlling all train, customer, ticket, and train information. The goal is to create an application software that will cut down on manual management of the train, booking, customers, and payments. It monitors a description of the Payment, Seat, and Ticket. The program is kept as simple as possible to reduce data entry errors. 

Additionally, it displays an error notice when you enter invalid data. The user doesn't require any formal training to use this system. This alone demonstrates how user-friendly it is. As previously said, the Railway Reservation System can result in an error-free, secure, dependable, and quick management system. Instead of focusing on record keeping, it can help users focus on their other activities. As a result, it will aid organizations in making better use of their resources.

Companies can keep computerized records updated without making duplicate inputs. To access the knowledge, one does not need to be side-tracked by irrelevant information.
